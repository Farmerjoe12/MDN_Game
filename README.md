# A Breakout clone written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

The core game logic is written in JavaScript, and the game takes place inside an HTML canvas. The intial game code came from a tutorial on the Mozilla Developers Network.

## Some additions I'd like to make

- Changes to ball/paddle physics

- Adding menus and other levels
